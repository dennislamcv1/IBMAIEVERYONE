    <h1>KONE</h1>
    <p>Elevators, escalators, and automatic doors ensure the passage of tens of thousands of people every day in the world’s tallest buildings. To keep people moving swiftly and safely takes an enormous amount of effort to plan routine maintenance and resolve unforeseen issues quickly. KONE services over a million elevators and escalators that move a billion people a day.</p>
    <p>KONE uses Watson to help monitor the condition of equipment and predict maintenance and upgrade requirements, to help the customer manage their equipment over its entire lifecycle. This means less downtime, fewer faults, and more detailed information for maintenance crews.</p>
