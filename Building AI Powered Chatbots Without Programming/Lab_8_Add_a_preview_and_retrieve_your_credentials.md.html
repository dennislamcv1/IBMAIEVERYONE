    <h4>Lab 8: Add a preview and retrieve your credentials</h4>
    <p>Objective for Exercise:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How to add a preview link.</li>
      <li>How to generate a wordpress site.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So far, the small chatbot we built works well enough from the <em>Try it out</em> panel. That's great, but our customers won't have access to it unless we deploy it somewhere. Let's see how to accomplish that.</p>
    <h1>Exercise 1: Add a Preview link</h1>
    <p>
      Assistants within Watson Assistant have an <em>Integrations</em> section from which we can select
      various way to deploy our chatbot. Before we look at how to deploy our chatbot on WordPress,
      in particular, it would be good to take advantage of the <em>Preview link</em> integration.
    </p>
    <p>This <em>Preview link</em> can be shared with friends and colleagues who'd like to try out your chatbot.</p>
    <p>To get the <em>Preview link</em> , Go to your Flowershop chatbot assistant,click at the top left home icon and <strong>click on</strong> <strong>Preview</strong>.</p>
    <img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-CB0103EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module5/images/Preview.png" width="600">
    <p>
      A link will be generated for you. Click on the <strong>Copy link to share</strong> <strong>icon</strong>, that’s your <em>Preview link</em> that you can share with
      others who are interested in trying out your chatbot. then .
    </p>
    <img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-CB0103EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module5/images/Copy%20link%20to%20preview.png" width="600">
    <p>
      Do bear in mind that every time someone sends a message to the chatbot, one API call is made,
      and it counts towards your free allowance (10,000 API calls per month in the Lite plan).
    </p>
    <p>
      Test it out to verify that the chatbot we built so far, does indeed work correctly from this user
      interface.
    </p>

    <h1>Exercise 2: Retrieve your chatbot credentials</h1>
    <p>The preview link is quite handy, but to deploy our chatbot in production, we need to collect our assistant’s credentials and note them.</p>
    <p>Go to the launch page of your <em><strong>Watson Assistant service</strong></em> you created. Make a note of the <em><strong>API Key</strong></em>.</p>
    <img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-CB0103EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module5/images/04%20(1)%20(1).png" width="600">
    <p>From the <em>Flower Shop Chatbot</em> assistant page , <strong>click on</strong> <em><strong>Live Environment</strong></em> from the left side of the page.</p>
    <img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-CB0103EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module5/images/01.png" width="600">
    <p><strong>Click on</strong> <em><strong>cog wheel</strong></em> next to the environment name.</p>
    <img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-CB0103EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module5/images/02.png" width="600">
    <p>Make a note of the <em><strong>Environment URL</strong></em> and then click on the <em><strong>close</strong></em> to close the Environment settings page.</p>
    <img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-CB0103EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module5/images/03__1___1_.png" width="600">
    <p>You'll need to use both the credentials in order to successfully deploy your chatbot later on.</p>
    <h1>Exercise 3: Generate a WordPress site</h1>
    <p>You followed along and now have a simple Flower Shop chatbot running in your Watson Assistant service. That's great, but how do we place it on an actual site?</p>
    <p>
      WordPress is a content management system that allows anyone to quickly have a website up
      and running. This platform has a lot of features out of the box, and many more can be added
      through plugins.
    </p>
    <p>
      We developed one such a plugin for Watson Assistant to make it extremely easy to place a
      chatbot on a WordPress site.
    </p>
    <p>We'll discuss the plugin in the next lab. But first, we need to create a WordPress site.</p>
    <p>In the next section of this module, you’ll find a button that will allow you to <em><strong>Generate a
WordPress site</strong></em>. Click on it to generate your site.</p>
    <pre><code class="hljs language-livecodeserver">Do <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">create</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">a</span> WordPress.com site. Generate <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> site <span class="hljs-keyword">using</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> tool provided. WordPress.com
expects you <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> pay <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> be able <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> install plugins. The WordPress(.org) installation we give you
already has <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> plugin installed.
</code></pre>
    <p>You'll be given details about your site, similarly to the ones shown in the figure below.</p>
    <img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-CB0103EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module5/images/8.9.PNG" width="600">
    <p>
      Please <strong>make note of these WordPress credentials</strong> you'll be given upon generating the site,
      you'll need them to log into the site in the next lab.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, write down somewhere your generated WordPress <em>Dashboard URL</em> (where you'll
      log in), your <em>username</em> , and your <em>password</em>. (Note that these are WordPress credentials and
      therefore different from the API ones you wrote down earlier in this lab).
    </p>
    <p>If you lose them, you can always come back to the next section of this module (i.e., <em><strong>Generate a
WordPress site</strong></em> ) and obtain them again.</p>
    <p>Without further ado, go ahead to the next section and actually generate your WordPress site.</p>
    <p>
      Please note that this site is for testing purposes only. Do not use it as your main site as it might
      be shut down after a certain period of time.
    </p>
    <h1>A note about Assistants and Skills</h1>
    <p>Assistants have one or more skills. Skills are linked to particular assistants.</p>
    <p>
      You don’t normally have to worry about this because a default assistant and a skill (already
      linked to each other) were automatically generated for us when we created our Watson
      Assistant instance.
    </p>
    <p>If, in the future, you were to create a new assistant, you’ll want to make sure to link it to a skill.</p>
    <p>
      Note that when you deploy your chatbot, you generally want to use the credentials from the
      assistant (like we did in this lab) and not from its skill.
