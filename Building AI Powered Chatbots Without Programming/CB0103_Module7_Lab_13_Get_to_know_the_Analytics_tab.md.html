    <h1>Exercise 1: Familiarize yourself with the Analytics tab</h1>
    <p>While working on your dialog skill, you might have noticed an <em>Analytics</em> tab. The Analyze page provides a summary of the interactions between users and your assistant.</p>

    <p>
      If you <strong>click on it</strong> , you'll see a dashboard with statistics and details about how your chatbot is
      being used.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is quite useful once you deploy your chatbot in the real world. You want to know how your
      chatbot is being used, observe the conversation people are having with it (as shown in the
      image below), and see if there are ways to improve the chatbot accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you find out that a lot of people are asking about something that your chatbot
      doesn't know how to handle, it might be time to create a new intent and node to handle that
      scenario and provide helpful responses to the user.
    </p>
    <p>To get started, choose the environment (draft or live) and date range you want to analyze. All charts and cards reflect data based on the environment and the date range you select. When you change the environment or the date range, the charts and cards on the page update to reflect the new date range.</p>
    <p>These three traffic metrics -- unique users, conversations, and user requests -- provide you with data about the volume of user engagements with your assistant.</p>

    <p>The completion and recognition charts provide information about the actions in your assistant.</p>
    <img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-CB0103EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module7/images/Recognition.png">
    <p>
      Likewise, if Watson misclassified an intent, it would be good to correct it and you can do so
      directly from the <em>Analytics</em> > <em>Conversation</em> tab. You can also use Refresh ensure the latest data is shown.
    </p>

    <p>
      The statistics are also helpful because they tell you what your customers are focusing on. With
      that knowledge in hand, you can invest more time to refine your chatbot to answer very in-
      demand questions.
    </p>
    <p>All this feedback can even be useful to refine the product itself at times.</p>
    <p>
      For example, if the users complain to your chatbot that they are unable to find a certain
      feature, it might be wise to improve the UI to make that feature more obvious or easy to find in
      the app itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's worth noting that this <em>Analytics</em> tab will be empty for you if you haven't had some
      conversation with the chatbot via the WordPress chat box. The reason for this is that <em>Try it
out</em> sessions are not included in the <em>Analytics</em> tab.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, go ahead and <strong>chat with your chatbot through the WordPress pop up chat window</strong> , if you
      haven't done so already. Then spend some time to <strong>familiarize yourself with
the</strong> <em><strong>Analytics</strong></em> <strong>capabilities built in Watson Assistant</strong> , by exploring this tab.
    </p>
    <h2>Congratulations</h2>
    <p>
      Congratulations on completing all the labs within this course! With the knowledge acquired so
      far, you should be able to build simple but useful chatbots and deploy them on websites
      powered by WordPress.
